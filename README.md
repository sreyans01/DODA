Discuss on Drawings

In a construction project, architectural drawings(refer to the image below) are developed before actual on-ground work start. Once drawings are developed, all planning, discussion, and reporting happen over drawings. Markers are used to mark a location on drawing images with some content
like text, images, person, discussion thread, etc.

An example of one such drawing is as shown.
